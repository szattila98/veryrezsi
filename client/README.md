## Development

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview` or `yarn preview`.
